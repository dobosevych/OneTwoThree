# Meetings App

Monorepo with a FastAPI backend (`back/`), a React + shadcn/ui frontend (`front/`) and PostgreSQL,
all started with Docker Compose. List meetings, add them (title, description, participants,
call link, place) and remove them.

## Run everything

```bash
make up          # = cp .env.example .env (first time) + docker compose up --build --wait
make help        # all targets: logs, test, lint, format, clean, aws-*
```

- App: http://localhost:3000
- API docs: http://localhost:3000/api/docs (or http://localhost:8000/api/docs directly)

If a host port is already taken, change `DB_PORT`, `BACKEND_PORT` or `FRONTEND_PORT` in `.env`.
`SEED=true` inserts 5 sample participants on first start. `docker compose down -v` wipes the database.

## API

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/health` | Liveness + DB check |
| GET | `/api/meetings` | List meetings with participants, newest first |
| GET | `/api/meetings/{id}` | One meeting |
| POST | `/api/meetings` | Create a meeting |
| DELETE | `/api/meetings/{id}` | Delete a meeting |
| GET | `/api/participants?q=` | List/search participants |
| POST | `/api/participants` | Create a participant (409 on duplicate email) |
| DELETE | `/api/participants/{id}` | Delete a participant |

All IDs are UUIDs. A meeting needs a title and at least one of `call_link` or `place`.

## Local development

Backend (needs a Postgres, e.g. `docker compose up -d db`):

```bash
cd back
uv sync
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://meetings:meetings@localhost:5432/meetings uv run alembic upgrade head
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://meetings:meetings@localhost:5432/meetings uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Frontend (Vite proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:8000`, override with `VITE_API_PROXY`):

```bash
cd front
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

## Tests

```bash
# backend: uses a separate database (created once)
docker compose exec db psql -U meetings -c "CREATE DATABASE meetings_test"
cd back && TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://meetings:meetings@localhost:5432/meetings_test uv run pytest

# frontend
cd front && npm test
```

## Code style

CI (`.github/workflows/code-style.yml`) runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests:

| Part | Tools | Run locally | Auto-fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `back/` | Ruff (lint + format) | `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .` | `uv run ruff check --fix . && uv run ruff format .` |
| `front/` | ESLint, Prettier, `tsc` | `npm run lint && npm run format:check && npm run typecheck` | `npm run format` |

Config lives in `back/pyproject.toml` (`[tool.ruff]`), `front/eslint.config.js` and `front/.prettierrc.json`.

## Deploy to AWS (backend on Lambda + Aurora Serverless, frontend on CloudFront)

Everything is deployed to **us-east-1**. CloudFront accepts custom-domain certificates only from that region. Infrastructure is CloudFormation in `infra/`:

- `infra/backend-ecr.yaml`: ECR repository for the backend's Lambda container image (`back/Dockerfile.lambda`).
- `infra/backend.yaml`: VPC with private subnets, Aurora Serverless v2 PostgreSQL (scales to 0 ACU when idle), and a Lambda function with a public **function URL**, which is the backend URL.
- `infra/frontend.yaml`: private S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution for the SPA on the **flat-rate Free plan** ($0/month, with the WAF web ACL the plan requires), with an optional custom domain.

Every resource carries the tag `PROJECT_NAME=<project>`. It is set in the templates and as a stack tag, and `cert.sh` puts it on the ACM certificate. Some resource types can't be tagged in AWS at all: function URLs, Lambda permissions, the bucket policy, the CloudFront origin access control, Route 53 records and the pricing plan subscription.

```

1. Put credentials into `.env` (an IAM user or role allowed to use CloudFormation, EC2/VPC, Lambda, ECR, RDS, Secrets Manager, S3, CloudFront, WAF, Pricing Plan Manager, ACM, Route 53, IAM and CloudWatch Logs):

   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
   ```

2. Optionally copy `infra/backend.params.example.env` to `infra/backend.params.env` to override stack parameters (memory, Aurora capacity, seeding, …).
3. Deploy. The first run takes about 15 minutes, mostly waiting for Aurora and CloudFront:

   ```bash
   make aws-deploy   # = aws-backend-deploy, then aws-frontend-deploy
   ```

   The steps run in this order:

   1. **Backend** (`make aws-backend-deploy`): ECR stack → build and push the Lambda image → backend stack → `aws-backend-migrate` invokes the function with `{"action": "migrate"}` to run Alembic and seeding. It prints the function URL (`https://<id>.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/`).
   2. **Frontend** (`make aws-frontend-deploy`): frontend stack → `npm run build` with `VITE_API_URL=<function URL>` → upload to S3 and invalidate CloudFront → update the backend's `CORS_ORIGINS` to allow the site's origin. It prints the site URL.

Other targets: `make aws-backend-outputs`, `aws-backend-status`, `aws-backend-logs`, `aws-backend-health`, `aws-backend-migrate`, `aws-frontend-outputs`, `aws-frontend-publish` (rebuild and upload the frontend only), `aws-destroy`. Use `ARCH=amd64` to build an x86 Lambda instead of Graviton (`arm64`, the default). Use `CLOUDFRONT_PLAN=PAY_AS_YOU_GO` if the account can't subscribe to the Free plan (accounts on the AWS Free Tier are not eligible, and each account gets at most 3 free plans).

### Custom domain for the frontend (optional)

By default the site is served on its `*.cloudfront.net` domain. To add a custom domain (default `onetwothree.dobosevych.com`, override with `FRONTEND_DOMAIN=app.example.com`), deploy once and then run:

```bash
make aws-frontend-cert        # 1. request the ACM certificate (free, us-east-1) and set up DNS validation
make aws-frontend-https       # 2. wait until it is issued, attach it to CloudFront, allow it in CORS, set up DNS
make aws-frontend-https-check # 3. curl https://onetwothree.dobosevych.com/
```

- **Domain's zone in Route 53 (same account):** the zone is found automatically. The validation record and alias `A`/`AAAA` records to CloudFront are created for you.
- **Any other DNS provider:** step 1 prints a validation `CNAME` to add there. Step 2 prints the `CNAME <domain> → <id>.cloudfront.net` record to add.

`make aws-frontend-cert-status` and `make aws-frontend-dns` show the records again. Once the certificate is issued, every later `make aws-deploy` keeps the domain. The backend stays on its function URL.

**Cost.** There is no load balancer, NAT gateway or public IPv4 address. Lambda and function URLs fit in the always-free tier for a small app. CloudFront runs on the flat-rate Free plan, which costs $0 with no overage charges and also covers its WAF web ACL (a per-IP rate limit). Requests that WAF blocks don't count toward the plan's allowance. Aurora Serverless v2 has no free tier. With `DbMinCapacity=0` it pauses after 5 idle minutes, and then you pay only for storage (about $0.10/GB-month). While active it costs about $0.12 per ACU-hour. The first request after a pause waits about 15 seconds while Aurora resumes. The DB credentials secret costs $0.40/month. Run `make aws-destroy` when you are done. It keeps a final Aurora snapshot.

On AWS the backend reads `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` instead of `DATABASE_URL`. The password is generated in Secrets Manager and resolved into the function's environment at deploy time, so the VPC needs no internet access. `DB_NULL_POOL=true` closes connections after each request, because idle connections from warm Lambdas would stop Aurora from pausing. Migrations do not run on cold start. `make aws-backend-migrate` runs them, and every `aws-backend-deploy` calls it.
